# Compaarision-of-ANN-activation-functions-and-Regression
Here I have compared different ANN activation functions and Regression to identify the which algorithm gives best result.

This project compare the Logistics Regression, and following ANN actuators
	sigmoid
	ReLU
	tanh

Finally confution matric is produces and following were calculated;
	Accuracy
	precision
	recall
	F1Score

You can Compare the performance of two algorithms for your dataset. Which one gave you the best results

Dataset can be found at: https://cdn.scribbr.com/wp-content/uploads//2020/02/heart.data_.zip?_ga=2.217642335.893016210.1598387608-409916526.1598387608
